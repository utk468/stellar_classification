Importance of the Project

The ability to accurately classify
astronomical objects is essential 
for a variety of reasons:

Scientific Research: Understanding
the composition and distribution
of different types of celestial
bodies can lead to insights 
about the formation and 
evolution of the universe.

Efficiency: Automating the classif
ication process allows astronomers
to analyze large datasets more
quickly and effectively,
freeing up valuable time for
 deeper investigations.

Educational Value: This project
serves as an excellent opportunity 
to apply machine learning
techniques to real-world
astronomical data, making 
it a valuable learning
experience for students and 
researchers in both astronomy and
data science.




Dataset Features
The Stellar Classification Dataset - SDSS17 comprises various features that provide critical information about each astronomical object. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the key features and their significance:

obj_ID: A unique identifier for each object in the dataset, allowing for precise tracking and referencing throughout the analysis.

alpha (Right Ascension) & delta (Declination): These coordinates define the object's position in the sky, similar to latitude and longitude on Earth. They are essential for locating celestial objects and conducting spatial analysis.

u, g, r, i, z: These photometric measurements represent the intensity of light detected in different wavelengths (ultraviolet to infrared). Analyzing these values helps in determining the object's temperature, chemical composition, and distance from Earth.

run_ID & rereun_ID: These identifiers specify the scan session and processing rerun of the data, ensuring that each observation is correctly matched with its imaging session.

cam_col (Camera Column): Indicates the specific scanline within a run, useful for identifying the exact instrument settings used during observation.

field_ID: Identifies the specific field of view during the observation, helping researchers understand the context of the data collected.

spec_obj_ID: A unique identifier for objects with spectroscopic measurements, linking photometric and spectroscopic data for more detailed analysis.

class: The categorical classification of the object (e.g., galaxy, star, quasar), which is the target variable for our machine learning models.

redshift: A measure of how much the light has shifted toward longer wavelengths due to the object's motion away from Earth, which is crucial for estimating distances and velocities.

plate, MJD, fiber_ID: These features provide information about the specific observations and instruments used, ensuring the data's reliability and facilitating future comparisons.
